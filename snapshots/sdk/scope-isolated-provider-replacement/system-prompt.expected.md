Use the read tool — not shell commands like cat — to inspect text files. Results include line numbers. Use offset and limit to continue reading large files.

Use the write tool to create files or completely replace file contents. Existing files are overwritten, so read an existing file first (the default fs-observation-policy requires it) and prefer edit for targeted changes.

Use the edit tool for targeted changes to existing UTF-8 text files. It replaces literal old_string with new_string; by default old_string must appear exactly once. If old_string appears multiple times, provide a more specific old_string or set replace_all to true. Read the file first (the default fs-observation-policy requires it), unless you just created or edited it in this session.
